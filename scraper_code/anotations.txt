Prototype plan:
- Create a scraper that collects the informations and returns a file with the informations collected
    - Number of students registered
- Create some real or mocked scraper's generated files to use as a test
    - Number of students registered in EDA 1
- Create a simple login system for the project
    - With a change password system
- Create a functionality where the user can insert the courses and the number of students currently registered
    - Can edit this information manually
    - Can upload a file with the informations
    - Can ask the scraper to get this information (this is optional, first check whether this is possible)
- Get an external allocation algorithm and integrate with the system
- Show the allocated classrooms. (final result)
